This Sentiment Analysis project was completed as part of an internship offered by InternStudio.
It focuses on classifying product reviews into positive, neutral, and negative categories using NLP techniques.
Text preprocessing includes tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal.
Machine learning models like Naive Bayes, SVM, and a deep learning LSTM model were implemented.
Visualizations such as word clouds and sentiment distribution charts were generated for insights.
The project demonstrates practical applications of NLP and sentiment classification in real-world datasets.
